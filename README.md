# AOM_web_scraping
A simple example of a Python script to scrape information of multiple websites - in this case of the names and affiliations of the participants to the Academy of Management Annual Meeting in 2014

This code is based on the workshop I taught at INSEAD on the use of Python coding in research in social sciences. I conducted a session on web scraping, while Julien Clement, another INSEAD PhD student, conducted a session on data manipulation and analysis with a particular focus on network analysis.

The companion PDF presentation covers the exercises done in class. The participants were first asked to complete the Codecademy introductory course in Python programming.
